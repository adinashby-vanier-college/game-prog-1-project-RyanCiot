Hello! This is my team's first game, it was a project given by our game
programming teacher. The purpose of this project/game, which is called 
The Haunted trials, is to defeat Dracula by going through all the levels.
The player will be moving with the aswd keys and arrow keys, will be 
avoiding all the ghosts, and will eventually defeat Dracula.
